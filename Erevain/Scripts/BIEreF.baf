// A script to "fix" Branwen's name and soundset, if it suddenly goes wrong. This is what happens when you select Branwen and press K(the script block about pressing K is in Branwen/Scripts/O#BranS.baf).
// This is going to be boring, but you got to take all your soundset lines from your Setup-MyMod.tp2 and copy them here like I just did.

// There is another way, if you want it. It's called traification. Download Coran NPC from http://www.pocketplane.net/coran and check his O#CoranF.baf and Setup-Coran.tra. You'll have to add LANGUAGE lines to your Setup-MyMod.tp2.
// TRA tutorials are available in Weidu's README, as well.

SetPlayerSound(Myself,~When asked about her past, BRANWEN reveals that she left her home of Seawolf in the Norheim isles at an early age. She was apparently reviled by her own people for wanting to become a priest, a station reserved exclusively for the men of the village. She harbors no resentment, realizing that her faith must face such tests or be worthless. She traveled the coast, offering her services to local militias, and eventually came into the employ of an adventuring troup in the Nashkel area. Branwen had no idea that the group was participating in banditry, however, and on their first raid she balked at attacking a caravan of unarmed merchants. She rebelled, and a mage named Tranzig turned her to stone in the ensuing fight. Despite the unfavorable outcome, Branwen feels that Tempus views her actions approvingly. To attack those that are unarmed is the basest of villainy.~,EXISTANCE5)
